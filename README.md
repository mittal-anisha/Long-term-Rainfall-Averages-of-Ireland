# Long-term-Rainfall-Averages-of-Ireland

## Research Question
This project will follow the approach of Mr. Seamus Walsh to construct a new set of LTAs for the period 1990-2020. However, the geostatistical methods used may differ and a subset of stations with complete data only will be considered. A comparison will be made between the LTAs for 1961-1990, and 1990-2020, to detect increases/decreases in Average Annual Rainfall, and other seasonal and monthly changes. All the rainfall data is available on the Met Éireann website. 

This paper will aim to specifically answer: 
### “What is the percentage change in monthly average rainfall in Ireland?”

## Research Objective 
People say that the climate and the weather have changed as compared to the previous year. We cannot say the climate changed in a year. It is not the correct method to measure this change. The change in climate and weather is studied over a longer period, approximately 30 years. We study the long-term averages (LTAs) or Climate Normals to place the current climate and weather in perspective. Therefore, we will use the long-term rainfall averages to answer our research question.

A new set of LTAs will be constructed for the period 1990-2020. The construction of the new averages will involve the collection and combining of the data, it relies on statistical techniques for data analysis and geostatistical techniques for generating gridded datasets.  Results from the LTAs for the years 1961 – 1990 will be used to compare the increase/decrease of monthly average rainfall in Ireland from 1990 - 2020.
